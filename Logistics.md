## Transportation

### Airport Shuttle Information
The Capital Metro provides a bus (Metro Bus 20) from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport to the UT Austin campus with service every 15 minutes. The Guadalupe/Dean Keaton Stop on this route arrives very close to Kinsolving Residence Hall (about 0.1 miles). The fare is $1.25 for a single ride or $2.50 for a day pass. You can buy passes on the bus, or can purchase a Local Day Pass in in advance [online](https://marketplace.bytemark.co/marketplace/cmta#event=0c6b57ea-7690-11e3-b180-0ee258328347). In fact, if you plan to travel around Austin a lot during your stay, you might consider getting a 7 day pass.

See the route on Google Maps [here](http://bit.ly/airport-dorm-bus).
