The 2019 MolSSI Software Summer School will be held July 22-31 at
The Texas Advanced Computing Center. The School will focus on early career graduate students in the computational molecular sciences (bio- and macro-molecular simulation, quantum chemistry, and materials science) whose research requires a firm foundation in software engineering and programming.

The School’s curriculum will focus on best practices in software engineering – version control, continuous integration, data management, programming paradigms, etc. – to promote reproducibility and reliability in research as well as aspects of modern high performance computing architectures and code
optimization.
